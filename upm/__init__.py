# upm/__init__.py
# This file marks the 'upm' directory as a Python package.
# It can also be used for package-wide configurations or initializations.

# It's good practice to import the main CLI entry point here
# so that `python -m upm` can potentially run the CLI.
# However, given the Typer setup, `cli.py` will handle the direct execution.
# For now, it remains minimal.
