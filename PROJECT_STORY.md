PROJECT STORY: The Origin of Unexpected Innovations / Legal Tender
Why this repo exists, who built it, and what’s next.

The Story Behind Unexpected Innovations and Legal Tender
On March 12, 2025, I set out to build a new kind of ESG platform. At first, it was just going to be a simple app—let users set their own filters, match companies to their values. I had no coding or AI experience.
All I had was a $300 laptop, free time, and an idea I couldn’t let go of.

The first thing that happened was after four weeks I realized I was not accomplishing what I had hoped. I had frameworks. But nothing substantial. So I switched gears and directions, I realized one AI wasn’t enough—my idea grew, and so did my needs. I ended up combining Grok, ChatGPT, and Gemini in ways that, at the time, felt perfectly logical. My entire method was “f*** up and fix it.” Weeks of struggle turned into a breakthrough: over 5,000 files, 70% production-ready, and a huge chunk of the UI/UX finished—something I now realize most people never reach.

I learned that modularity wasn’t a preference, it was a necessity. AI token limits forced me to keep file sizes small, which accidentally made the whole codebase more contributor-friendly.
This repo is an open-source subset: the Legal Tender Toolkit, focused on secure digital assets and ESG compliance.
I built these tools specifically for open sourcing. I researched what’s really useful (and hard to find) for developers, and, using the same kind of “insanity” that drove me at the start, I started with a Merkle Tree, a UPM, a Zero Trust Authenticator, and a Telemetry Receiver.
As of writing this, I’m finishing UPM testing. Each tool will be released here as it passes my (thorough) tests.

They’re not perfect, and I know it. But I want these to be genuinely useful for the community.
Take them, build on them, learn from them—they’re yours.
I’m not seeking adoption or industry dominance. I just wanted to make something people need, and make it free for everyone.

And yes—I really did build this in about a week (plus a lot of late-night testing).

I know some people won’t believe it. How could a 53-year-old sci-fi/fantasy writer with zero tech background pull this off, with just AI tools and a bargain laptop?
That’s not my problem. My only goal is to make a real contribution.

What’s Next: The Legal Tender App
While this repo is a toolkit of building blocks, my bigger goal is to make ethical, transparent investing accessible to everyone—and built around your ethics, not someone else’s definition.

That’s why I’m working on Legal Tender: an app that puts the power, clarity, and control of ESG/ethical investing in the hands of everyday people.
No jargon. No gatekeeping. No secret formulas. You decide what’s “good” or “bad.” You define your own morality.

What Sets Legal Tender Apart
You control what matters: Adjust sliders to match your priorities—climate, worker rights, ethics, diversity, and more (10 main categories, 40+ subcategories).

Instant feedback: Watch scores and rankings update live as you fine-tune your values.

Total transparency: Every step and score is fully auditable—no black boxes.

Safer, smarter investing: Simulate risks, run Monte Carlo and Multiverse “what ifs,” see true impacts.

Privacy by design: Your values and data stay private, protected by cutting-edge privacy tech.

Meet Arbiter: Your Personal Investment Assistant
Legal Tender features Arbiter—an intelligent, built-in assistant who helps you set your preferences, explains your options, and answers your questions in plain English.
Arbiter learns from your decisions, explores “what if” scenarios, and makes every recommendation fully transparent.

No other investing app offers this kind of personalized, transparent guidance.

If you want to follow along, contribute, or just see what’s possible with stubbornness, AI, and a kitchen-table laptop—welcome aboard.
I hope you find these tools useful.
