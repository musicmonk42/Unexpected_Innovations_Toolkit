First up: **UPM (Universal Package Manager)** — the gold standard for cross-ecosystem package management.

## 📖 Project Story: The Origin of Unexpected Innovations / Legal Tender

On March 12, 2025, I set out to build a new kind of ESG platform. At first, it was just going to be a simple app—let users set their own filters, match companies to their values.  
I had no coding or AI experience. All I had was a $300 laptop, free time, and an idea I couldn’t let go of.

After four weeks, I realized I was spinning my wheels. Frameworks, but nothing real. So I switched gears and directions—discovered that one AI wasn’t enough. My idea grew, and so did my needs. I combined Grok, ChatGPT, and Gemini in ways that, at the time, felt perfectly logical. My entire method was “f*** up and fix it.” Weeks of struggle turned into a breakthrough: over **5,000 files, 70% production-ready**, and a huge chunk of the UI/UX finished—something I now realize most people never reach.

**Modularity wasn’t just a preference, it was a necessity.**  
AI token limits forced me to keep file sizes small—accidentally making the codebase much more contributor-friendly.

This repo is an open-source subset: the Legal Tender Toolkit, focused on secure digital assets and ESG compliance.  
I built these tools specifically for open sourcing—researched what’s useful (and hard to find) for developers. Using the same kind of “insanity” that drove me at the start, I started with a Merkle Tree, a UPM, a Zero Trust Authenticator, and a Telemetry Receiver.  
As of writing this, I’m finishing UPM testing. Each tool will be released here as it passes my (thorough) tests.

They’re not perfect, and I know it. But I want these to be genuinely useful for the community.  
Take them, build on them, learn from them—they’re yours.

> I’m not seeking adoption or industry dominance. I just wanted to make something people need, and make it free for everyone.  
> And yes—I really did build this in about a week (plus a lot of late-night testing).

I know some people won’t believe it. How could a 53-year-old sci-fi/fantasy writer with zero tech background pull this off, with just AI tools and a bargain laptop?  
That’s not my problem. My only goal is to make a real contribution.

## 🌱 What’s Next: The Legal Tender App

While this repo is a toolkit of building blocks, my bigger goal is to make ethical, transparent investing accessible to everyone—and built around **your ethics**, not someone else’s definition.

That’s why I’m working on **Legal Tender**: an app that puts the power, clarity, and control of ESG/ethical investing in the hands of everyday people.
- **No jargon. No gatekeeping. No secret formulas.** You decide what’s “good” or “bad.” You define your own morality.

## ✨ What Sets Legal Tender Apart

- **You control what matters:** Adjust sliders to match your priorities—climate, worker rights, ethics, diversity, and more (10 main categories, 40+ subcategories).
- **Instant feedback:** Watch scores and rankings update live as you fine-tune your values.
- **Total transparency:** Every step and score is fully auditable—no black boxes.
- **Safer, smarter investing:** Simulate risks, run Monte Carlo and Multiverse “what ifs,” see true impacts.
- **Privacy by design:** Your values and data stay private, protected by cutting-edge privacy tech.
