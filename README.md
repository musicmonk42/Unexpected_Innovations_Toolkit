## 🚀 What is This Repo?

This repository is the home of the **Unexpected Innovations Toolkit**—starting with the **Universal Package Manager (UPM)**, a next-generation, security-focused package manager and plugin sandbox engine.  
UPM is designed for maximum transparency, auditable installs, supply-chain trust, and uncompromising process isolation.

**Vision:**  
Build a suite of open, robust, and developer-friendly tools for security, compliance, and reliability—starting with UPM, and soon to include advanced modules like a time-travel debugger and adaptive cache system.

---

## 🌎 Project Philosophy

- **Open Source for All:**  
  UPM and every tool here is released under a permissive open-source license. The goal is empowerment, transparency, and learning—no gatekeeping.
- **Security & Auditability:**  
  Every design choice prioritizes sandboxing, logging, and testability.
- **For Builders and Defenders:**  
  If you care about secure workflows, reproducibility, and supply-chain trust, this toolkit is for you.
